## Features

- üöó **Line Navigation:** Navigate predefined paths using IR sensor arrays and color sensors.
- üî¢ **Bar Counting:** Detect and count horizontal bars placed along a predefined path.
- üß≠ **Maze Navigation:** Grab a virtual box and navigate through a maze to place it in the target location.
- ü§ñ **Box Arrangement:** Arrange a set of boxes in ascending or descending order of height using a custom SolidWorks-designed mechanical robot arm powered by servo motors. A Sharp IR sensor integrated into the robotic gripper allows for height differentiation.
- üåà **Color Line Following:** Follow a colored line on the ground using color sensors.
- üìè **Dashed Line Following:** Follow a dashed line using the IR sensors.
- üö™ **Portal Navigation:** Detect and navigate through portals or gateways.
- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Hidden Task and Chamber Insertion:** Solve a hidden task and insert a box inside a chamber.
- ü™ô **Coin Drop:** Drop a coin into a specific target area.

## Design Overview

### Hardware requirements:
Sensors

The robot employs various sensors for accurate detection and navigation, including:

- **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Employed for detecting walls and chambers.
- **Sharp IR Sensor:** Mounted on top for measuring distance, especially during portal navigation and for box height differentiation.
- **TCS34725 Color Sensor:** Used for color detection in line following tasks.
- **REKHA TCRT5000 Reflectance Sensor Array:** For precise line tracking.

 **Actuators**
- Robotic arm and gripper: Gripper mechanism and slider operations for lifting boxes are performed using two MG90S servo motors.

**JGA25-370 DC motor**
- integrated to the wheels of the robot.

 **Microcontrollers**
- Arduino Mega 2560- The microcontroller that controls all the functionalities of the robot



### Mechanical Design

The mechanical design of the robot was fully customized using SolidWorks, encompassing both the chassis and the robotic arm. The robotic arm, equipped with a gripper, utilizes a rack-and-pinion mechanism for precise linear movement, enabling efficient box grabbing, lifting, and dropping operations.

The chassis features a two-layer acrylic board structure, mounted with spacers for stability. This compact design was carefully crafted to optimize space and ensure the robot can effectively carry out its tasks.

## Algorithms

The robot‚Äôs navigation algorithms rely on real-time data from the sensors. Each task follows a defined sequence, enabling the robot to adapt its actions based on sensor inputs. The algorithms include:

### Barcode Detection
- Measures duration exposed to white segments to determine the end of the barcode.

### Box Handling
- Includes height measurement, grabbing, lifting, and placing based on color-coded signals.

### Path Navigation
- Controls the robot‚Äôs movement along predefined paths while avoiding obstacles.
