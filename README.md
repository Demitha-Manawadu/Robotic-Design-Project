# Robotic Design Project - Multi-Task Robot

## Introduction
This project is focused on designing and building a robot capable of performing various tasks in an autonomous environment. The robot is equipped with sensors and actuators to handle tasks such as bar counting, line navigation, maze navigation, box manipulation, and more. This robot is designed for use in [name of competition or event, if applicable] and follows a modular design approach to handle different tasks sequentially.

The robot uses an Arduino as the control unit and includes a set of sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, infrared) for navigation and object manipulation.

## Tasks to be Accomplished

The robot is programmed to complete the following tasks:

1. **Bar Counting**: Detect and count bars along a path.
2. **Line Navigation**: Follow a solid line to navigate.
3. **Maze Navigation**: Navigate through a maze and find the exit.
4. **Box Manipulation**: Manipulate boxes (pick and place or push).
5. **Color Line Following**: Follow a colored line on the ground.
6. **Dashed Line Following**: Follow a dashed line using the right sensors.
7. **Portal Navigation**: Detect and navigate through portals or gateways.
8. **Box Arrangement**: Arrange boxes in a specific order.
9. **Hidden Task and Chamber Insertion**: Solve hidden tasks or perform actions in specific chambers.
10. **Coin Drop**: Drop a coin into a specific target area.
11. **Task Completion**: Ensure all tasks are completed successfully.
